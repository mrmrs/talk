# TALK

This is a simple template that I use to put talks together.
Hopefully it can be useful for you.

I don't use fancy slide programs to cycle through slides. I just
use preview for OS X. This Adobe Illustrator template includes a commonly
used grid system as well as a color palette that will work on projectors and
TVs while still being readadle from a distance.
